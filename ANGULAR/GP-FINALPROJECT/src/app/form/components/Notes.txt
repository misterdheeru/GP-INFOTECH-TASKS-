 

### Explanation of `::ng-deep`

`::ng-deep` is a deprecated CSS selector in Angular used to apply styles to child components. Normally, Angularâ€™s view encapsulation restricts styles to the component they are defined in. However, `::ng-deep` allows styles to penetrate this boundary and affect nested child components.

#### Key Points:
- **Purpose:** To apply styles to elements inside child components.
- **Behavior:** Without `::ng-deep`, styles are scoped to a single component. With `::ng-deep`, styles can "reach" into child components.
- **Deprecation:** `::ng-deep` is deprecated and should be avoided for future-proofing. Consider alternatives like shared styles or CSS inheritance.
